**Survey Analysis**

**1. Participant Overview**

A total of 60 participants completed the survey. All responses were included in the analysis. Participants reported a range of indoor environmental conditions and activity levels during the winter season.

Analysis & Discussion 
The findings of this study indicate associations between indoor environmental conditions and perceived comfort during winter. Variations in temperature, humidity, clothing insulation, and activity level were accompanied by measurable differences in comfort scores and the frequency of minor health symptoms, suggesting that everyday indoor environments may contribute to subjective well-being.
One prominent trend observed was the relationship between perceived humidity and both comfort and minor health symptoms. Participants reporting very dry indoor environments demonstrated comparable mean comfort scores but a higher frequency of dry skin and headaches. The limited variation in comfort scores may reflect behavioral adaptation, such as increased clothing insulation or heating, which can mask the impact of low humidity on subjective comfort. The observed association between low humidity and increased reports of dry skin aligns with known physiological effects of dry air on skin barrier function, where reduced ambient moisture can increase transepidermal water loss and contribute to irritation and discomfort. While causation cannot be established, the consistency of this pattern across participants highlights the relevance of humidity as a component of indoor environmental quality.
Temperature also showed a clear relationship with comfort levels. Mean comfort scores were relatively similar across temperature ranges, suggesting that within typical indoor winter conditions, temperature alone may not strongly differentiate perceived comfort. This pattern suggests that thermal neutrality plays an important role in perceived indoor comfort, particularly during winter months when external cold may influence heating practices and individual thermal perception.
Clothing layers provided additional context for thermal comfort. Higher numbers of clothing layers worn indoors were more frequently reported among participants with lower indoor temperature, indicating that increased clothing insulation may reflect colder indoor environments rather than personal preference alone. This trend supports the interpretation that clothing behavior can act as an indirect indicator of inadequate thermal regulation within indoor spaces.
