# Winter Indoor Comfort Study – Figures Summary

This file provides a descriptive summary of key trends and visual patterns observed in the survey data. It acts as a **words-only version of the figures** that would normally be plotted in charts.

---

## 1. Comfort vs Temperature

- **Trend:** Comfort scores are highest (7–10) at **21–23°C**.  
- **Observation:** Cool rooms (18–20°C) show moderate comfort scores (3–8), while cold (<18°C) or very warm (>26°C) rooms show wider variability.  
- **Takeaway:** Temperature is a major factor influencing comfort; participants adjust clothing and activity to compensate for non-ideal temperatures.

---

## 2. Symptoms vs Humidity

- **Trend:** Very dry conditions result in more frequent reports of:  
  - Dry skin/lips  
  - Headache  
  - Cold hands/feet  
  - Fatigue  
  - Difficulty concentrating  
- **Observation:** Comfortable or slightly dry humidity corresponds to fewer reported symptoms.  
- **Takeaway:** Maintaining proper indoor humidity reduces winter-related discomfort.

## 3. Clothing Layers vs Temperature

- **Trend:**  
  - Cold rooms → 2–3 layers  
  - Comfortable rooms → 1–2 layers  
  - Warm rooms → 2 or more layers (individual variation)  
- **Observation:** Clothing is a behavioral adaptation to maintain comfort under varying temperatures.  
- **Takeaway:** Layering compensates for environmental extremes.

## 4. Activity vs Comfort & Symptoms

- **Trend:** Sedentary participants in cold or dry rooms report more symptoms.  
- **Observation:** Moderate activity reduces discomfort and cold-related complaints.  
- **Takeaway:** Movement indoors acts as an adaptive mechanism to maintain comfort.

---

## 5. Duration Indoors vs Symptoms

- **Trend:** Longer indoor durations (>10–14 hours) in cold/dry conditions correlate with higher incidence of symptoms.  
- **Observation:** Shorter exposure reduces symptom frequency.  
- **Takeaway:** Extended time in suboptimal environments amplifies minor health complaints.

---

## 6. Combined Observations

- **Optimal conditions for comfort:**  
  - Temperature: 21–23°C  
  - Humidity: Comfortable  
  - Clothing: 1–2 layers  
  - Activity: Moderate  
- **Behavioral adaptations:** Participants use clothing and activity adjustments to cope with cold, dry, or warm conditions.  
- **Trends:**  
  - Cold + dry → higher symptoms  
  - Comfortable temp + humidity → high comfort, fewer complaints  
  - Activity helps mitigate discomfort when temperature/humidity are suboptimal.

## 7. Key Insights

1. Temperature and humidity are **primary drivers** of perceived comfort.  
2. Clothing layers and activity serve as **compensatory mechanisms**.  
3. Cold and dry environments result in the **most frequent minor symptoms**.  
4. Longer indoor exposure intensifies discomfort.  
5. Words-only “figures” summarize patterns clearly for a **quick overview** without the need for Excel or charts.
