# Figures: Visual Summary of Results

This section provides a descriptive, figure-style summary of key patterns observed in the survey data. Instead of graphical plots, trends are described in words to highlight the most prominent distributions and comparisons.

## Figure 1: Distribution of Indoor Temperature
The most frequently reported indoor temperature range was 21–23°C (comfortable), followed closely by 18–20°C (cool). Fewer participants reported temperatures below 18°C, while warm and very warm indoor environments were least common.

## Figure 2: Indoor Humidity Perception
Responses were concentrated around “comfortable” and “slightly dry” humidity levels. Reports of very dry indoor air were present across multiple temperature ranges, while humid conditions were comparatively uncommon.

## Figure 3: Clothing Layers Worn Indoors
Most participants reported wearing two clothing layers indoors during winter. One-layer and three-layer responses were also common, suggesting variability in personal thermal regulation strategies.

## Figure 4: Activity Level While Indoors
The dominant activity level was mostly sedentary, followed by moderate and light activity. High activity levels were rare, indicating that most indoor time during winter is spent with limited physical movement.

## Figure 5: Combined Environmental Patterns
Comfortable temperature and humidity conditions were often associated with fewer adaptive behaviors, such as reduced clothing layers or lower activity levels. In contrast, colder or drier environments coincided with increased layering or higher activity, reflecting compensatory responses.

These descriptions summarize the primary visual trends that would be observed in corresponding charts or plots.
