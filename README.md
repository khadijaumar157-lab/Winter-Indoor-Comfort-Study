# Winter-Indoor-Comfort-Study
## Overview

This project investigates how indoor environmental conditions affect perceived comfort and minor health symptoms during winter. Using a survey-based approach, data were collected on temperature, humidity, clothing layers, and activity levels, along with self-reported comfort and symptom scores. 

The analysis explored correlations between environmental variables and comfort, revealing that:  
- Moderate temperature and humidity levels are associated with higher comfort scores.  
- Clothing and activity levels can significantly buffer the effects of colder or drier indoor conditions.  
- Small adjustments to indoor environments can meaningfully improve well-being during winter months.
