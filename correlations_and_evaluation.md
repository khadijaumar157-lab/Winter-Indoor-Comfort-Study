# Winter Indoor Comfort Study – Correlations & Evaluation

This file provides a detailed evaluation of relationships and correlations between indoor environmental conditions, clothing, activity levels, perceived comfort, and reported symptoms during winter. The goal is to highlight patterns and behavioral adaptations.

## 1. Temperature vs Comfort

- Participants in **21–23°C (comfortable)** reported the **highest comfort scores** (mostly 7–10).  
- **18–20°C (cool)** produced more variable comfort scores (3–8), showing that some participants adapted better than others.  
- **Below 18°C (cold)** led to **moderate comfort scores** (4–9) despite clothing adjustments.  
- **Above 26°C (very warm)** was tolerated reasonably well if clothing layers were reduced, showing **adaptive behavior**.  

**Evaluation:** Temperature is the primary predictor of perceived comfort. Comfort scores drop when rooms are cold or very warm unless participants adjust clothing or activity.

## 2. Humidity vs Symptoms

- **Very dry conditions** correlated with **dry skin/lips, headaches, fatigue, cold hands/feet, and concentration issues**.  
- **Slightly dry or comfortable humidity** reduced the incidence of these symptoms.  
- **Slightly humid conditions** were less common but did not appear to significantly affect comfort scores.  

**Evaluation:** Maintaining moderate humidity is critical to reducing winter-related minor health symptoms. Very dry indoor air exacerbates discomfort even in otherwise comfortable temperatures.

## 3. Clothing Layers vs Temperature

- **Colder environments (<18°C)** → more layers worn (2–3 layers).  
- **Comfortable rooms (21–23°C)** → fewer layers (1–2 layers).  
- **Very warm rooms (24–26°C)** → some participants wore 2 layers or more, suggesting individual variation in comfort preferences.  

**Evaluation:** Clothing is an effective compensatory mechanism. Participants adjust layers to maintain comfort, especially in non-ideal temperatures.

## 4. Activity vs Symptoms

- **Sedentary behavior** in cold or dry rooms was associated with **higher frequency of symptoms** such as cold hands/feet, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating.  
- **Moderate activity** (housework or light movement) appeared to **mitigate some discomfort**, particularly in cooler rooms.  
- High activity indoors was rare but generally coincided with higher comfort scores.  

**Evaluation:** Physical activity acts as a behavioral adaptation to improve thermal comfort and reduce symptom incidence in suboptimal environments.

## 5. Duration Indoors vs Symptoms

- Participants spending **>10–14 hours indoors** experienced **more frequent minor health complaints** when rooms were cold or dry.  
- Shorter indoor durations (<6 hours) in cold or dry conditions still resulted in some discomfort but less consistently.  

**Evaluation:** Extended exposure to suboptimal indoor environments compounds minor symptoms, highlighting the cumulative effect of environmental stressors.

## 6. Combined Correlations

- **Optimal comfort** observed when:  
  - Temperature: 21–23°C  
  - Humidity: Comfortable  
  - Clothing: 1–2 layers  
  - Activity: Moderate  
- **Suboptimal conditions** (cold/dry or very warm) required behavioral adjustments through clothing or activity to maintain comfort.  
- Participants rarely relied on one factor alone—temperature, humidity, clothing, and activity all interact to influence comfort and symptoms.  

**Evaluation:** Indoor comfort is multifactorial. Behavioral adaptation (clothing and activity) significantly moderates the impact of environmental extremes.

## 7. Key Takeaways

1. **Temperature and humidity are the strongest predictors** of comfort and symptom occurrence.  
2. **Clothing layers and activity** are effective adaptive mechanisms.  
3. **Cold and dry conditions** lead to higher rates of fatigue, headaches, and cold extremities.  
4. **Extended indoor duration** amplifies minor health complaints.  
5. Optimal winter indoor comfort requires **moderate temperature, comfortable humidity, appropriate clothing, and some movement**.
