# Correlations and Evaluation

This section evaluates observed relationships between indoor environmental conditions and adaptive behaviors reported by participants.

## Temperature and Clothing Adaptation
Lower indoor temperatures (below 18°C and 18–20°C) were frequently associated with increased clothing layers. Participants reporting colder environments were more likely to wear two or three layers, suggesting clothing serves as a primary adaptive mechanism for thermal comfort.

## Temperature and Activity Level
Participants in cooler indoor environments often reported moderate or light activity, whereas mostly sedentary behavior was more commonly reported in comfortable temperature ranges (21–23°C). This suggests activity level may partially compensate for thermal discomfort in colder conditions.

## Humidity Perception and Comfort
Very dry and slightly dry humidity levels were commonly reported across multiple temperature ranges. The frequent reporting of dry indoor air indicates that humidity may be an important factor influencing winter indoor comfort, independent of temperature.

## Combined Environmental Effects
Comfortable indoor temperatures combined with comfortable humidity were often associated with fewer adaptive behaviors, such as reduced clothing layers or lower activity levels. In contrast, less optimal conditions required multiple compensatory strategies.

## Limitations
- Environmental conditions were subjectively reported rather than instrument-measured.
- Comfort was inferred through behavioral adaptation rather than directly quantified.
- The sample size limits generalizability.

Despite these limitations, the data reveal consistent trends in how individuals adapt to indoor environmental conditions during winter.
