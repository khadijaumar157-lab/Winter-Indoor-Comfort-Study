# Winter Indoor Comfort Study – Analysis

This file summarizes patterns observed from the survey data on indoor environmental conditions, clothing, activity, and perceived comfort during winter.  

---

## Indoor Temperature

- Most participants reported spending time indoors at **21–23°C (comfortable)**, followed by **18–20°C (cool)**.  
- Fewer participants reported temperatures **below 18°C (cold)** or **above 26°C (very warm)**.  
- Comfortable temperatures were associated with **higher comfort scores** (7–10), while cooler or very warm conditions had slightly more variability.

---

## Indoor Humidity

- Most reported humidity as **comfortable** or **slightly dry**, with fewer experiencing very dry or humid conditions.  
- **Very dry conditions** were linked to **dry skin, dry lips, headaches, and cold hands/feet**.  
- Slightly humid conditions showed no consistent effect on comfort scores.

---

## Clothing Layers

- **Two layers** were most common indoors, with **one layer** or **three layers** depending on temperature.  
- **Cold rooms (<18°C)** → more layers worn.  
- **Warm rooms (24–26°C)** → usually 2 layers, with a few wearing >3 layers.

---

## Activity Level

- Most participants reported **mostly sedentary activity** (sitting, studying).  
- **Moderate activity** (housework/movement) was next most common.  
- **Light and high activity** were rare.  
- Lower activity often coincided with cooler/drier environments, possibly to conserve heat.

---

## Perceived Comfort (1–10 scale)

- Higher comfort scores (**7–10**) occurred at **21–23°C** with comfortable humidity.  
- Scores dropped in **cool (18–20°C) and dry environments**, even when clothing layers were adjusted.  
- Extreme temperature/humidity could be offset by clothing or activity.

---

## Common Symptoms

- Most reported symptoms:  
  - Dry skin or lips  
  - Cold hands/feet  
  - Fatigue  
  - Headache  
  - Difficulty concentrating  
- Cold (<18°C) and very dry conditions → more symptoms.

---

## Duration Indoors

- Many spent **>10–14 hours indoors**.  
- Long indoor durations in cold/dry environments → increased symptom reports.

---

## Observed Patterns & Correlations

1. **Temperature ↔ Comfort & Clothing Layers**  
   - Colder rooms → more layers, moderate activity, slightly lower comfort.  
   - Comfortable rooms → fewer layers, higher comfort.

2. **Humidity ↔ Symptoms**  
   - Very dry → dry skin/lips, headaches, fatigue.  
   - Comfortable/slightly dry → fewer complaints.

3. **Activity ↔ Adaptive Response**  
   - Sedentary participants in cold/dry rooms → more symptoms. Movement mitigates discomfort.

4. **Combined Environmental Patterns**  
   - Optimal comfort: **21–23°C, comfortable humidity, 1–2 layers, moderate activity**.  
   - Extremes require behavioral adaptation.

### Summary

Indoor comfort in winter is primarily influenced by **temperature and humidity**. Participants adapt using **clothing layers and activity**, but cold and dry conditions still lead to minor symptoms. These findings highlight how **environmental and behavioral factors combine to affect comfort**.
