# Survey Summary

This section summarizes responses collected on indoor environmental conditions and personal adaptation during winter. All variables are self-reported.

## Indoor Temperature
Most participants reported spending the majority of their indoor time in environments ranging from 18–23°C. The most frequently reported category was 21–23°C (comfortable), followed by 18–20°C (cool). A smaller proportion reported indoor temperatures below 18°C, while fewer participants experienced warmer indoor conditions (24–26°C or above).

## Indoor Humidity
Reported indoor humidity levels varied. The most common responses were “comfortable” and “slightly dry.” Several participants reported very dry indoor air, while humid conditions were less frequently reported.

## Clothing Layers
Participants commonly reported wearing 2 layers indoors during winter. One-layer and three-layer clothing patterns were also observed, indicating variability in personal thermal adaptation. Very few participants reported wearing more than three layers.

## Activity Level
Most participants described their indoor activity level as mostly sedentary. Moderate activity was the second most common response, followed by light activity. High activity levels were reported infrequently.

## Overall Pattern
Responses suggest a wide range of indoor environmental experiences, with participants adapting through clothing choices and activity levels to maintain comfort during winter.
